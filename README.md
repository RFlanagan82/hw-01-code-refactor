# hw-01-code-refactor-Horiseon

## Description

This refactor edit was to remove div tag redundancy and replace it with proper HTML semantic code using applicable tags to more easily identify the key elements of the Horiseon homepage.

Key new tags used included: header and nav tags, figure tags for the hero image, section and user tags.

Id addributes were removed since they weren't needed and Alt tags were added for the images included in the html file.

## Usage

By inspecting each of the image tags you'll be able to see a refenced alt description for an easy to understand identifier.

## Credits

I leveraged https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp to help me with understanding which element would fit best for each div tag replacement.

I also used https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ for the License boilerplate text.

I collaborated with fellow classmate Jonathan Canales via a Study group session in Discord.
